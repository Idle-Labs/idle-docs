### 1. Deposit USDC in Idle's Clearpool Wintermute PYTs

Go to [Idle Finance](https://idle.finance/#/tranches/clearpool/USDC) and enjoy the different risk-return profiles of the Perpetual Yield Tranches.

* Choose the Perpetual Yield Tranches side of preference selecting either _Senior_ or _Junior Tranches_ under the _Earn_ section in the top-bar

{% hint style="info" %}
Using **Senior Tranches**, in case of hacks or losses, users' funds will be covered by the funds deposited in the Junior Tranche.

Using **Junior Tranches**, in case of hacks or losses, users' funds will be employed first to cover Senior depositors' funds and then shared among Junior users.
{% endhint %}
