# Deposit funds on PYTs

## **Deposit funds**

This tutorial will guide users in the process of depositing new funds in Idle through the Perpetual Yield Tranches on the Ethereum mainnet.

## <mark style="color:blue;">Ethereum</mark>

The sections [Before starting](../../best-yield/guides/deposit-funds-on-by.md#before-you-start) and [Connecting to the Idle dApp](../../best-yield/guides/deposit-funds-on-by.md#connecting-your-wallet) under the Best Yield strategy can be helpful to have a smooth onboarding in the Idle dApp.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Using **Senior Tranches**, in case of hacks or losses, users' funds will be covered by the funds deposited in the Junior Tranche.

Using **Junior Tranches**, in case of hacks or losses, users' funds will be employed first to cover Senior depositors' funds and then shared among Junior users.
{% endhint %}

### Depositing assets

1. Choose the _Senior Tranches_ or _Junior Tranches_ strategy in the topbar under _Earn_. There are different [assets](../overview.md#protocols-and-assets) available (i.e. DAI, USDC, USDT) offering different _APY_s depending on supply and demand equilibria and the tranches side chosen.&#x20;
2. The user should click on the asset he wishes to deposit.
3. Insert the number of tokens in the right panel and click on deposit. The smart contract will automatically set the gas limit based on current data.&#x20;
   * First-time users will be asked to approve the token spending on the contract before depositing. The spending allowance can be unlimited or exact. Users can then check their spending limits on third-party tools such as [Revoke Cash](https://revoke.cash/).
   * Once the approval is confirmed, the user will be able to deposit the approved asset into the PYTs of choice. He will now possess `IdleCDO_AA/BB` tokens for the asset deposited.&#x20;
   * By visiting the _Dashboard_ page, the user will be able to see an overview and the performance of his deposit/s.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that the gas limit should not be decreased to ensure that the transaction does not fail and it's executed promptly.
