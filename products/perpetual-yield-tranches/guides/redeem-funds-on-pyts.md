### Redeem funds

1. Visit the [Idle dApp](https://app.idle.finance/#/dashboard) and connect your wallet.
2. Go to the _Senior/Junior Tranches_ page under the _Earn_ section. There will be a _Deposited assets_ section showing the balances deposited.&#x20;
3. Click on the token of interest.&#x20;
4. In the right panel, click on _Withdraw_ and then insert the amount of token to redeem.&#x20;
5. After the Tx executes, users will see their tokenized asset balance and any redeemed governance tokens less the current performance fee.
