# Fee structure

Idle strategies charge a **performance fee deducted from the earned yields**.&#x20;

### Best Yield

For _Best Yield_ strategies, the fees are charged at funds redeem. Accrued fees are routed to the `FeeCollector`contract governed by $IDLE token holders.

{% hint style="info" %}
The fees generated by the Senior Best Yield strategies are split between the Rebalancer, the Fee Treasury and the stkIDLE stakers.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

* Accrued _Senior_ _Best Yield_ fees go to the [`FeeCollector`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xBecC659Bfc6EDcA552fa1A67451cC6b38a0108E4)
  * When fees in the `FeeCollector` reach a minimum swap amount threshold of 0.5 WETH, the `FeeCollector` does a swap and split the amount as follows:&#x20;
    1. 30% to [`Rebalancer`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb3c8e5534f0063545cbbb7ce86854bf42db8872b): covering the harvest costs and funds movement of BY
    2. 20% to [`FeeTreasury`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x69a62C24F16d4914a48919613e8eE330641Bcb94): funding the DAO treasury
    3. 50% to [`StakingFeeSwapper`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1594375eee2481ca5c1d2f6ce15034816794e8a3): rewarding IDLE stakers
* Accrued _Junior Best Yield_ fees currently go to the [`Treasury League multisig`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xFb3bD022D5DAcF95eE28a6B07825D4Ff9C5b3814)

| BY                | 10% performance fee  | 15% performance fee  |

| Junior Best Yield |                      | :white\_check\_mark: |

### Yield Tranches

For the _Yield Tranches_ strategies, a 10-15% performance fee is deducted from earned yield every time a YTs auto-compound accrued rewards. Accrued fees are currently routed to the [`Treasury League multisig`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xFb3bD022D5DAcF95eE28a6B07825D4Ff9C5b3814).

| YTs                                  | 10% performance fee  | 15% performance fee  |

{% hint style="info" %}
Performance Fees are computed by difference using the average `IdleToken` or `IdleCDO`price paid by the user for all their deposits and the current `IdleToken` or `IdleCDO`price. All transfer methods (`tranfer` and `transferFrom`) of IdleToken will also transfer the eventual fee debt to the receiver.
