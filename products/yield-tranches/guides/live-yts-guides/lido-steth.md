This tutorial will guide users in the process of depositing new funds on the Lido YTs on top of the stETH market.

To deposit into the stETH YTs, follow these two steps:

1. Use [Lido](https://stake.lido.fi/) to stake your ETH
2. Deposit Lido LP tokens in Lido's stETH YTs

### 2. Deposit Lido LP tokens in Idle's YTs

After having staked ETH on Lido, the user can go back to Idle and enjoy the different risk-return profiles of the Yield Tranches.&#x20;

* Choose the Yield Tranches side of preference selecting either _Senior_ or _Junior Tranches_ under the _Earn_ section in the top-bar

{% hint style="info" %}
Using **Senior Tranches**, in case of hacks or losses, users' funds will be covered by the funds deposited in the Junior Tranche.

Using **Junior Tranches**, in case of hacks or losses, users' funds will be employed first to cover Senior depositors' funds and then shared among Junior users.
{% endhint %}

1. Type in the amount to deploy on the Tranche in the right panel
2. Click on _Approve_ to approve the token spend limit (1st Tx)
3. Once the spending approval is confirmed, the user will be able to deposit stETH Lido LP tokens
4. Click on _Deposit_ to deposit the funds (2nd Tx)
5. The user will receive back `wstETH-LP` tokens for the asset deposited depending on the side of the PYTs chosen (AA\_wstETH-LP for Senior, BB\_wstETH-LP for Junior)
