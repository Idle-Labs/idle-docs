> _In the financial world, a tranche represents a product split that carries specific features like risk, yields, duration. They are often arranged together to create pools of diversified products or a basket of investments with similar characteristics (risk-return related)_.

Based on this concept, Idle launched its own tranches primitive: [Yield Tranches](https://idle.finance/#/dashboard/tranches).

Each tranched asset has its own yield source, with two risk-adjusted investment profiles (Senior and Junior).&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
Taking the stETH Yield Tranche based on the Instadapp stETH pool as an example, stETH deposited into the Senior and Junior classes of that Instadapp-based strategy are aggregated into a single pool and then deployed into the Instadapp Lite market.
{% endhint %}

Tranches allow users to enjoy DeFi yields with **built-in protection on deposits** for Senior depositors or **boosted yield** for Junior ones.

{% hint style="info" %}
Users can decide the strategy according to their risk profile: they can deposit funds into two different tranches (**Senior** or **Junior**) in exchange for a token indicating their claim.
{% endhint %}
