# Introduction

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Product suite.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Idle DAO is a decentralized collective that builds a set of products that aim to unlock the power of decentralized finance as a one-stop source of yield. It allows users to algorithmically optimize their digital asset allocation across leading DeFi protocols, whether they want to maximize it or keep tabs on their risk-return profile.

The <mark style="color:blue;">**Product Suite**</mark> is currently composed of

| <p>A lending aggregator that automatically analyses supply rate functions across integrated protocols and total funds in the pool to constantly rebalance capital across any number of protocols to <strong>earn the highest interest rate possible</strong> with very high precision. <br><br>It is currently available for <strong>Ethereum</strong> and <strong>Polygon</strong> networks<strong>.</strong> </p> | <p>YTs are capital pools that automatically generate and tranche yields and risks based on a range of market-neutral yield strategies, including lending income, trading fees from Automated Market Makers, and protocol incentive farming.  <br><br>Pools are associated with two risk-adjusted classes: <strong>Senior</strong> and <strong>Junior</strong> tranches.</p> |

{% content-ref url="fees.md" %}
[fees.md](fees.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

With a clear explanation of the fees applied to the Idle's strategies.

{% content-ref url="get-involved/integrators-program.md" %}
[integrators-program.md](get-involved/integrators-program.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

With a focus on the integration process for DAOs and DeFi platforms that want to leverage the Idle product suite, either on [Ethereum](broken-reference) or [Polygon](broken-reference).
