3. Click on the token of interest.&#x20;
4. In the right panel, click _Withdraw_ and then insert the amount of token to redeem.&#x20;
5. After the Tx executes, users will see their tokenized asset balance and any redeemed governance tokens less the current performance fee.

### Redeem interest-bearing tokens

{% hint style="warning" %}
This feature is active only on Senior BY and only if the contract is paused to let users always have the possibility to redeem their funds (as interest-bearing tokens).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

If the Senior BY contract is paused, users can decide to withdraw their funds in the form of interest-bearing tokens (e.g. aDAI/cDAI/eDAI). To do so:

1. Follow the steps outlined in the [Redeem funds section](redeem-funds-on-by.md#redeem-funds) up to point 3.
2. In the right panel, click on _Withdraw._&#x20;
3. Tick the _Withdraw interest-bearing tokens_ option
4. Click on _Withdraw interest-bearing_

## <mark style="color:purple;">Polygon</mark>

All the above steps can be followed to redeem funds from the BY OG strategy on Polygon as well.

To cover gas fees on Polygon, you will need to own $MATIC to redeem your funds.
