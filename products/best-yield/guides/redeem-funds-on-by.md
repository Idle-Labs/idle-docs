# Redeem funds on BY

## <mark style="color:blue;">Ethereum</mark>

### Redeem funds

1. Visit the [Idle dApp](https://app.idle.finance/#/dashboard) and connect your wallet.
2. Go to the BY strategy page under the _Earn_ section. There will be a _Deposited assets_ section showing the balances deposited.&#x20;
3. Click on the token of interest.&#x20;
4. In the right panel, click on _Withdraw_ and then insert the amount of token to redeem.&#x20;
5. After the Tx executes, users will see their tokenized asset balance and any redeemed governance tokens less the current performance fee.

All the above steps can be followed to redeem funds from the BY OG strategy on Polygon as well.

To cover gas fees on Polygon you will need to own $MATIC to redeem your funds.
