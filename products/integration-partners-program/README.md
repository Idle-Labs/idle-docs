Our partners build platforms and technologies that help investors earn more effectively by enabling new types of businesses and new wealth sources.

**➡️ **<mark style="color:blue;">**We’ve designed a program to help accelerate and amplify partnerships' impact.**</mark>

The Idle **Integration Partners Program** allows developers or DAOs/institutional treasury managers to efficiently integrate the Idle product suite into their own services and workflow.

Any partner that integrates Idle products can earn up to a 50% profit share from the contributed TVL, adding an additional revenue stream for their business.
