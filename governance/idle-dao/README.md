# Idle DAO

Since November 26th, 2020, the Idle protocol is governed and owned by a DAO powered by the [IDLE governance token](../idle/). The Idle DAO promotes key activities to ensure proper protocol’s maintenance and improvements in the years to come.

{% hint style="info" %}
Idle governance is based on the Governor Bravo governance architecture, for a more in-depth description of all methods available please refer to the official guide [here](https://compound.finance/docs/governance).
{% endhint %}

The Idle DAO, composed by $IDLE token holders, enables community participants to drive and contribute to the protocol’s future developments. **Protocol changes are implemented through IIPs** (Idle Improvement Proposals).

All admin powers have been transferred to $IDLE holders, allowing the community to lead maintenance and development of the protocol.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The ability to pause deposit and rebalance actions are still in place for security purposes in case of emergencies and are maintained by the Guardian multi-sig. The `guardian` can be changed at any time by the governance with a proposal.

The Security Management Policy for the protocol is further explained [here for BY](../../developers/best-yield/security-management-policy.md) and [here for PYT](../../developers/perpetual-yield-tranches/security-management-policy.md).

In early 2021, Idle DAO decided to implement a [**Leagues (subDAOs) model**](idle-leagues/), as a solution to the scaling problems that DAOs face.&#x20;

Given the amorphous nature of the organizational structure of a DAO, varied participation often occurs and most members tend towards relatively passive participation. Rather than leaving every $IDLE token holder with the burden of planning, executing, and voting on all the aspects of the protocol, each subDAO takes care of the daily maintenance of the related area of expertise using the budget assigned by $IDLE token holders, on a mandate basis.&#x20;
