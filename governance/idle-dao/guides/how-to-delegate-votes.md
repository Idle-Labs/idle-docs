# How to delegate votes

In the Idle Governance system, each $IDLE corresponds to one vote. IDLE token holders can vote through self-delegation or can delegate the voting right to any Ethereum address to vote on their behalf. As a delegator, you can change anytime the selected delegate.

## Off-chain votes

Off-chain votes are managed through [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/). It's not needed to self-delegate your voting address, but you can delegate another wallet following these steps:

1. Visit the Snapshot's delegation page [https://snapshot.org/#/delegate](https://snapshot.org/#/delegate)
2. Enter the address you want to delegate to
3. To limit delegation to a specific space, tap on the switch button and enter the space key you want your delegation to take effect on (example: `idlefinance.eth`). If no space is selected, the effect will take place for all Snapshot's spaces.
4. Click confirm to save your delegation and sign the Tx

## On-chain votes

#### **Self-delegate**

Holding IDLE tokens does not mean you are automatically eligible to vote, but you have to go through a further step and assign that power to yourself (self-delegate).

#### **Receive delegations**

If you receive a delegation, you cannot further delegate the amount delegated to you to other people (you can only delegate votes corresponding to your IDLE tokens). By the way, if your delegators increase their stake and hold more IDLE, they don’t have to re-delegate the added funds as your voting balance will be automatically updated.

### **Connect your wallet and visit the Governance dashboard**

Click on this link to visit the [Governance dashboard](https://idle.finance/#/governance) on idle.finance. Then connect your wallet in the left part of the header, choose “Ethereum Wallet” and select your wallet type.

### **A. Delegation process through the **_**Proposal**_** page**

Once a proposal is live, you can click on it and browse the details.\
The upper part of the page shows the delegation feature. Here you can paste the address of your third-party delegate or self-delegate your voting rights.

### **B. Delegation process through the **_**Delegate**_** page**

If you want to change the delegate or no proposals are active, click on the “Delegate” category in the menu on the left.\
Here you can see how many IDLE tokens you are owning and set the new delegate or self-delegate the voting power.
