# How to vote for an IIP

If it is your first time voting, you should check first the [How to delegate votes](how-to-delegate-votes.md) guide to explore how self-delegation works or how to receive votes from IDLE token holders.\
In the case of third-party delegation, you must have received the delegation before the activation of a proposal, otherwise, you are not eligible to cast the delegated votes to that proposal.

### **Browse the proposals' list**

Once in the Governance dashboard, click on “Proposals” in the menu on the left and you will be redirected to the full list of Governance Proposals, arranged in chronological order.&#x20;

You can also filter the proposal list to show only the proposals of interest.

### **Explore a proposal**

The header of the proposal page provides summary info about

* the proposer
* the proposal status (active, pending, queued, executed, rejected)
* the proposal activity history
* the actions that would be implemented if executed

The second part of the page describes the details of the proposal in simple terms and lists the addresses (with their voting weight) that are in favour or against the proposal.

### **Vote on a proposal**

After a careful review of the proposal (only active proposals accept votes) and the [self-delegation](how-to-delegate-votes.md#self-delegate), click the “Vote” button.\
Here you can choose to cast a “For” and “Against” vote. After choosing a voting action, a modal asks you to confirm the transaction via your Ethereum wallet. Confirming that action, the modal provides the transaction containing the voting data.

You can only vote once, so double-check your action before broadcasting it to the mainnet.

Come back to the proposal dashboard and you will see your votes already added to the counter.
