# Lending, borrowing & collateral

### <mark style="color:blue;">IDLE vote lending and borrowing</mark>

Paladin is a voting market protocol. With our collaboration with Paladin, IDLE token holders can lend their tokens via Paladin in return for yield and allow the borrower of the token to vote in the Idle DAO for on-chain proposals. Delegating your DAO voting power is a great way to get yield on your IDLE governance tokens while encouraging active DAO participation.&#x20;

_Using IDLE as collateral is not currently supported on Paladin._
