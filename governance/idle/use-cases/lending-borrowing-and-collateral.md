# Lending, borrowing & collateral

## <mark style="color:blue;">Ethereum</mark>

## Paladin <a href="#paladin-30" id="paladin-30"></a>

### <mark style="color:blue;">$IDLE vote lending and borrowing</mark>

Paladin is a voting market protocol. With our collaboration with Paladin, $IDLE token holders can lend their tokens via Paladin in return for yield and allow the borrower of the token to vote in the Idle DAO for on-chain proposals. Delegating your DAO voting power is a great way to get yield on your $IDLE governance tokens while encouraging active DAO participation.&#x20;

_Using $IDLE as collateral is not currently supported on Paladin._
