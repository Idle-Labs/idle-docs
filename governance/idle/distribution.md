# Distribution

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Distribution.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The IDLE distribution (via the LPs Fund) is broken down into three different programs:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Gauges" %}
_Status: Live_

This program will last 6 months and will use 30% of the $IDLE allocated to the liquidity mining program resulting in a 990 $IDLE/day distribution over a semester (178,200 $IDLE in total).

Currently, the Gauges system distributes rewards to Senior Perpetual Yield Tranches.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Liquidity Mining" %}
_Status: Live_

This program will last 2 years and is used to reward liquidity providers depending on the amount of funds deposited and the utility generated by the pool (APY of the pool); it will distribute **18%** **of the total supply (2'340'000 IDLE)** on a per-block basis across all Idle Best Yield strategies.\
\
Part of the funds devoted to liquidity mining for the BY strategy has been moved to the Gauges system of the Perpetual Yield Tranches.&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Long-term Rewards" %}
_Status: distribution voted by Idle DAO_

This program is meant to reward long-term actors and liquidity providers of the Idle ecosystem. **20%** **of the total supply (2'600'000 IDLE)** is allocated to this program.

The long-term distribution program won't start right at the governance launch, but 20% of the total supply has already been reserved and sent to the `LongLPFund` [`0x107A369bc066c77FF061c7d2420618a6ce31B925`](http://etherscan.io/address/0x107A369bc066c77FF061c7d2420618a6ce31B925) which is managed by the governance.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Liquidity Bootstrap" %}
_Status: Ended_

This program distributed **3% of the total supply (390'000 IDLE)** to liquidity during the _first 30 days_ after governance inception. It has been based on the Liquidity Mining program with applied an x4 multiplier to the basic reward amount per block.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

The _Liquidity Mining_ program distributes IDLE through the `IdleController` contract, which computes the utility generated by each BY strategy (idleDAI, idleUSDC, ...) and proportionally allocates the IDLE rewards between all these pools. \
To compute the utility generated by each strategy, the IdleController uses a `PriceOracle` which reads data such as WBTC or COMP price (in USD) and uses it to compute the correct share of LM program distribution for each pool. \
To update the _distribution speeds_, and effectively adjust the IDLE distribution for the strategies depending on current TVL and APYs, the public method `refreshIdleSpeeds` should be called from time to time.

Funds for the _Liquidity Mining_ and the _Liquidity Bootstrap_ programs have been sent to the `Reservoir` contract which progressively unlocks IDLE rewards for the `IdleController`. In order to transfer unlocked IDLE from the `Reservoir` to the `IdleController` the Reserve contract should be poked by calling the `drip` method.\
\
_Gauges_ rewards are distributed through the `Distributor`contract.

{% hint style="info" %}
The governance is also responsible for managing the **Ecosystem Fund** [`0xb0aA1f98523Ec15932dd5fAAC5d86e57115571C7`](http://etherscan.io/address/0xb0aA1f98523Ec15932dd5fAAC5d86e57115571C7) which represents **15%** **of the total supply (1'950'000 IDLE).** This fund's purpose is to fund Idle DAO and its community.
{% endhint %}

Additionally, **4%** **of the total supply (520'000 IDLE)** has been reserved, at launch, to **Early LPs** through the Early Rewards contract [`0xa1F71ED24ABA6c8Da8ca8C046bBc9804625d88Fc`](http://etherscan.io/address/0xa1F71ED24ABA6c8Da8ca8C046bBc9804625d88Fc).&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Early Rewards not claimed 90 days after launch (26th November 2020) have been automatically transferred to the Ecosystem Fund.
{% endhint %}

The remaining 40% of the supply is allocated in the following manner:

* _Team + Future Team:_ 22.7% of the total supply (with a 3 year lockup: 33.33% unlocked after 1 year, 66.67% unlocked linearly for the next 24 months)
* _Investors:_ 17.3 % of the total supply (with a 2 year lockup: 25% unlocked after 6 months, 75% unlocked linearly for the next 18 months)

Both lockup schedules started on Nov 26th 2020, and are enforced through the following smart contracts:

The above IDLE emission schedule does not take into account the _Ecosystem Fund_ and the _LongTerm LPs Program_ funds. Those will be deployed via an IDLE community vote.
