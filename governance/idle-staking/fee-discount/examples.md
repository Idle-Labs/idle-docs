### Examples

For a matter of clearness, letâ€™s see a practical example with the [Clearpool Yield Tranches on top of the Portofino DAI borrowing pool](https://app.idle.finance/#/earn/yield-tranches/0x38d36353d07cfb92650822d9c31fb4ada1c73d6e) that offers a risk-adjusted opportunity to enter the uncollateralized lending market.&#x20;

* The Junior tranche offers an average gross APY of 16.66%, corresponding to a 14.16% net APY.

#### **Yield focus**

The table sums up the IDLE needed to access the discount tiers, the corresponding yields generated and the minimum DAI deposit amounts to offset the initial IDLE expenditure in 1, 3 or 6 months using only the yields generated by each tier.

#### Discount focus

Alternatively, the focus can shift to the discounts generated. The table sums up the IDLE needed to access the discount tiers, the corresponding yields generated and the minimum deposit amounts to offset the initial IDLE expenditure in 3, 6 months or 1 year using only the discounts applied to each tier.
