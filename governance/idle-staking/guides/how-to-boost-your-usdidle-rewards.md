# How to boost your $IDLE rewards

To vote on Gauges and share weight preferences, users should use the [Gauges menu](https://idle.finance/#/dashboard/gauges) in the Idle dashboard.&#x20;

### Staking

User can further [boost their IDLE rewards](../boost.md) by staking their pool token holdings.&#x20;

The process is similar to the usual [IDLE staking](how-to-stake-your-usdidle.md) mechanism.&#x20;

The Gauges dashboard will show you live how your boosting multiplier will change as you increase your staking share in the pool.&#x20;

In case of multiple rewards pools (as for example currently the Lido - stETH PYT), you can claim separately either the IDLE or the LDO rewards.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that the additional gauge rewards (LDO from MultiRewards) are not affected by boosts like IDLE rewards and are simply distributed proportionally to the user share in the gauge.
