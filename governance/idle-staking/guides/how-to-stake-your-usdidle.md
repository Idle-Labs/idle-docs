# How to stake your $IDLE

### Staking

To stake your $IDLE visit this [stake page](https://idle.finance/#/dashboard/stake) in the idle.finance dashboard, then

1. Approve the $IDLE staking contract to allow the staking.
2. Now you can lock your $IDLE. You should set two variables:
   1. **Lock period duration**: from a minimum of 2 weeks to a maximum of 4 years
   2. **$IDLE amount**: based on your balance select how many $IDLE you want to lock
3. Click on _Lock_ and sign the transaction.

Be careful when approving the spending limit of the staking contract. It's advisable to approve an amount near your current/expected $IDLE balance.
{% endhint %}

[The longer is your staking period, the higher will be the stkIDLE received at the time of locking](../#lock-details). For example, by staking your $IDLE for 4 years you will receive back 1 stkIDLE per $IDLE locked (i.e. 100%).

### Claim rewards

Once locked in your $IDLE, you will start receiving $IDLE rewards and you can claim them using the dedicated action in the idle.finance dashboard.&#x20;

The dashboard will show your the claimable $IDLE amount and the previous claim calls

### Update your staking

Once you have locked your $IDLE, you cannot revert the operation until the lock end date has been reached. You can instead&#x20;

* _Increase Time_: increase the locking duration&#x20;
* _Increase Amount_: increase the $IDLE locked

Every time, you modify the _Time_ or _Amount_ the APR will be adjusted consequently.

Once the end date is reached you can't increase your stake. First, you need to withdraw the tokens and then you can stake again.&#x20;
