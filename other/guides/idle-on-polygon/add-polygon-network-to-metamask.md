# Add Polygon network to MetaMask

First, you need to map a new network (i.e. _Polygon_) on your wallet. Hereafter, we will use the Metamask wallet. You can either choose to add _Polygon_ manually or automatically using third party services.

### Add _Polygon_ manually

Click on your _Metamask_ extension, select _Ethereum_ mainnet and choose Custom RPC from the list. Fill in the menu with the following information:

* Network Name: Polygon Mainnet&#x20;
* New RPC URL: [https://polygon-rpc.com/ ](https://polygon-rpc.com/)
* Chain ID: 137&#x20;
* Currency Symbol (optional): Matic&#x20;
* Block Explorer URL (optional): [https://polygonscan.com/](https://polygonscan.com/)

### Add _Polygon_ through _Chainlist_

Visit [www.chainlist.org](https://chainlist.org/) to add _Polygon_ to _Metamask_. Connect your wallet to the _Chainlist_ dApp in the top right corner. Once connected, search _Polygon_, choose _Polygon_ Mainnet and select Add to _Metamask_. _Metamask_ will ask “Allow this site to add a network?” approve it, then select _Switch Network_. You should now see _Polygon_ Mainnet in the _Metamask_ networks drop-down list.

_Matic_, used to cover gas fees on the _Polygon_ network, will be listed automatically. If you want to add some additional tokens to your balance click on Import tokens. To add _$IDLE_ tokens to your wallet list:

* Token Contract Address: [0xc25351811983818c9fe6d8c580531819c8ade90f](https://polygonscan.com/token/0xc25351811983818c9fe6d8c580531819c8ade90f)
* Token Symbol: _IDLE_ (autogenerated)
* Token Decimal: 18 (autogenerated)

Similarly, you can add [WETH](https://polygonscan.com/token/0x7ceb23fd6bc0add59e62ac25578270cff1b9f619) or any other token of your choice. Always remember to look for the Polygon contract address.

Once mapped the new network you can visit [www.polygon.idle.finance](https://polygon.idle.finance)
