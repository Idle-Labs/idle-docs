# Stake IDLE LP tokens on Polygon

Liquidity providers for the IDLE/WETH pair in Sushiswap can stake their SLP tokens using the dedicated [staking page](https://polygon.idle.finance/#/dashboard/stake). This will allow them to receive $IDLE rewards.

The program will distribute 20'000 $IDLE over 3 months, using the time-weighted Ampleforth Geyser model.
