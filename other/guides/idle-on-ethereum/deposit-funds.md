# Deposit funds on Ethereum

## **Deposit funds**

This tutorial will guide you in the process of depositing new funds in Idle through Best Yield strategy on Ethereum mainnet.

### **Before you start**

To ensure yourself a smooth onboarding on Idle be sure to have the following items ready:

* A supported Ethereum wallet (_Metamask_, _Coinbase wallet_, _Portis_, _Fortmatic_, _Authereum_);
* Tokenized assets (DAI, USDC, USDT, SUSD, TUSD, WETH, WBTC, RAI);
* Ether (ETH) to cover network fees (i.e. gas).

### Connecting your wallet

1. From the idle.finance homepage click on "_Go To Dashboard"._
2. Click "_Connect_", choose ‘_Ethereum Wallet_’, then select your supported wallet type from the list. In this guide, we will use the _Metamask_ browser wallet.
   1. If you have multiple addresses in your wallet, select the one you are planning on using to make a deposit and click "_Next" and "Connect"._
3. If the connection is successful, in the top left corner you will see the connected wallet, as well your $IDLE balance (this will be shown as zero for new users).

### Depositing assets

1. Choose the "_Best Yield_" strategy in the sidebar on the left-hand side (you can learn more about Idle strategies by visiting each _Product page,_ [_Best Yield_](../../../products/best-yield/) and [_Yield Tranches_](../../../products/yield-tranches/)). Here, we will use the Best-Yield strategy. There are different assets available (DAI, USDC, USDT) offering different _APY_s depending on supply and demand equilibria.
2. Click "_Deposit_" next to the asset you wish to deposit.
   1. If you do not currently possess any of the respective assets you will be given the option to purchase them via the built-in on-ramps or conversion partners.
3. Click "_Approve"_, then "_Confirm_" the transaction in your wallet to approve your fund deposit. You can click on _"_Edit" to increase the gas price if the network is busy (visit [https://www.blocknative.com/gas-estimator](https://www.blocknative.com/gas-estimator) for current rates) and speed up the transaction completion.
4. Once the approval is confirmed, you are now able to deposit your approved asset into the Idle Strategy of choice. You will now possess _IdleYield_ or _IdleRisk_ tokens for the asset you deposited depending on the strategy you chose. By clicking on your wallet, you can see your current portfolio assets and $IDLE balance.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that you should not decrease the gas limit, and you should set the gas price to ensure the transaction completes promptly, otherwise you will risk failed transactions and wasted gas fees.
