# How to add $IDLE to MetaMask

You have just started your journey to invest smarter with Idle and you got some $IDLE. \
Do you want to see your $IDLE balance on MetaMask? Follow these simple steps:

1. Click on the Metamask extension and select the wallet you linked to Idle.Finance
2. Scroll down and click on _Import Token_
3. Then click on _Custom Tokens_ and add the following info
   * Token Contract Address: `0x875773784Af8135eA0ef43b5a374AaD105c5D39e`&#x20;
   * Token Symbol: IDLE&#x20;
   * Token Decimal: 18 (should be auto-filled after the address addition)
4. Click on _Add Custom Token_.&#x20;
5. Now you should be able to see your $IDLE balance on the main wallet page.

**Alternatively**, you can let MetaMask do the work by activating the Token Detection feature under Settings > Experimental (please bear in mind that this feature will use 3rd party API).
