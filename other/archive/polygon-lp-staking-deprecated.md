# Polygon LP staking (deprecated)

### **What is LP Staking?**

Whenever liquidity is deposited into an AMM pool, specific tokens known as _liquidity providers tokens (_LP tokens) are minted and sent to the providerâ€™s address. The proportion of the poolâ€™s liquidity provided determines the number of liquidity tokens the provider receives. A liquidity pool is a core mechanism of AMM (Automated Market Makers), where at least two assets are deposited to form a trading pair.&#x20;

By staking your LP tokens into the Polygon LP Staking Program, users are entitled to receive additional rewards in the form of $IDLE.

### **LP Staking Program Rationale**

LP staking is a way to incentivize liquidity provisioning for IDLE/WETH pairs on decentralized exchanges. Idle Leagues [proposed](https://gov.idle.finance/t/3-phase-proposal-to-foster-liquidity-provision-lp-staking-analysis/681) this reward mechanism and Governance approved the deployment of the staking contracts. Idle Governance launched this LP staking program using the same model applied for [Ethereum LP Staking program](sushiswap-lp-staking.md) (Ampleforth Geyser model) to reward liquidity providers that became part of the Idle ecosystem on Polygon.

### **How LP staking works**

Check out the [How to join LP staking on Polygon](../guides/idle-on-polygon/) guide.

### **Time-Weighted Distribution Mechanism**

The Geyser contract has a built-in mechanism intended to incentivize long-term liquidity providers. While there are no hard lockups for staking, there is a benefit to keeping your staked position longer.&#x20;

The reward multiplier linearly increases over the following periods:

* 0-1 month    -> from 1x up to 2x
* 1-2 months  -> from 2x up to 3x
* 2-3 months  -> 3x

By holding the funds in the staking contract until the final rewarding block, LPs will receive the token bonuses not accrued by LPs that withdrew funds earlier.
