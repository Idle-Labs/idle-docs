# Bridge $IDLE to Polygon

### Ethereum to Polygon

To move $IDLE from Ethereum mainnet to Polygon mainnet you should use a bridge service.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
_**Your wallet address will be the same on both chains**_. The same is not applicable for multisig wallets. In the latter case, use an EOA wallet to move tokens between an Ethereum multisig wallet and a Polygon one.
{% endhint %}

Visit [www.wallet.polygon.technology](https://wallet.polygon.technology/) and connect your wallet. Check that you are on the Ethereum network, then select _Polygon Bridge_ (Figure 1). Click on Ether and look for _$IDLE_. Choose the amount to move from Ethereum to _Polygon_ and click on _Transfer_.

Click on Continue three times (you will be able to see an estimate of gas fees). Confirm the transaction (consisting of two steps, i.e. Approve deposit and Complete deposit) on _Metamask_. A _Transfer_ in progress window will show the tx progress. Once completed, the new deposit will take \~7/8 minutes to reach your _Polygon_ wallet.

### Polygon to Ethereum

Similarly, you can follow similar steps to move your tokens from Polygon to Ethereum. In this case, the bridge will take around \~3 hours to move the funds back to the mainnet.
