# Add liquidity to $IDLE pools

### Sushiswap pool

_Sushiswap_ liquidity pools are placed to pool tokens so that users can use them to make trades in a decentralized way. These pools are created by users and decentralized apps (or dApps, for short) who want to profit from their usage. To pool liquidity, the amounts a user supplies must be equally divided between two tokens: the primary token (sometimes called the quote token, i.e. _$IDLE_) and the base token (usually ETH or a stable coin).

When you deposit liquidity in Sushi, you will receive SLP (Sushi Liquidity Provider token). That tokens represent your liquidity deployment in such pool.

The incentivized pair is [WETH/IDLE](https://analytics-polygon.sushi.com/pairs/0x5518a3af961eee8771657050c5cb23d2b3e2f6ee). Go to "Stake $IDLE on Polygon" to know how to deposit SLPs into the staking contract.

$IDLE is available on Sushi UI, but it can be also manually imported:
