# Integrate PYTs

ðŸ’¡ The integration of this product means opening the door to a new DeFi scenario: trancheTokens, which are ERC-20 tokens, enable the Idle protocol to unlock many use cases. These tokens could be used as collateral and traded in many financial instruments.

Additionally, you can integrate Tranches as an underlying yield source of your product, adding value for your users in the long term.

If you are interested in building Tranches on your product or in working together to explore more opportunities with Tranches, [fill out this form](https://idlefinance.typeform.com/to/PUC7nO).
{% endhint %}

As an integration partner, you will be able to offer new products for onboarding additional TVL via a tailored risk-adjusted product offering.

Idle Leagues are looking forward to supporting your integration ideas.

## Technical documentation
